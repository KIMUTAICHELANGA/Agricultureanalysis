# Dataset Exploration and Clustering Analysis

## Introduction:

The provided dataset offers valuable insights into worldwide food production, particularly focusing on the comparison between food intended for human consumption and that intended for animal feed. This dataset, sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), serves as a rich resource for understanding global food supply trends over time. The analysis conducted on this dataset aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of global food production dynamics.

## Analysis Overview:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Initial exploration of the dataset, including data overview and visualization.
   - Analysis of food and feed production across different countries.
   - Identification of top food and feed producers.
   - Examination of production trends over the years.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creation of new features to enhance analysis and insights.
   - Calculation of mean produce and ranking of countries based on productivity.
   - Evaluation of most produced food items and their trends.

3. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Application of K-means clustering algorithm to classify countries based on productivity scale.
   - Selection of optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
   - Visualization of clustering results and interpretation of findings.

## Tools and Techniques:

- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Data Analysis Techniques**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Clustering (K-means)
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, Scatter Plots, Factor Plots

## Repository Structure:

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook and required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
3. Open and run the `main.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter to explore the analysis.
4. Follow along with the code and comments to understand each step of the analysis process.
5. Experiment with different parameters and techniques to further explore the dataset.

## Conclusion:

The analysis conducted on the FAO dataset provides valuable insights into global food production trends and patterns. From identifying top producers to exploring production trends over time, the analysis offers a comprehensive overview of the dataset. Additionally, the clustering analysis helps classify countries based on productivity scale, providing further insights into the distribution of food production worldwide.
